# Crime-Analysis

There is an abundance of crime data which is collected everyday throughout the country but analyzing and taking decisions based of that is difficult for the officials. By using the dashboard, we can provide them the insights and location specific data which would be otherwise not paid much attention to.

The results of crime analysis will help in assisting our law enforcement officers with understanding their environment and guiding them in implementing specific strategies for crime reduction.
